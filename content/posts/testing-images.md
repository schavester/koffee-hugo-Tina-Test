Man is an artifact designed for space travel. he is not designed to remain in his present biologic state any more than a tadpole is designed to remain a tadpole. in deep sadness there is no place for sentimentality. there is nothing more provocative than minding your own business. to be an outlaw you must first have a base in law to reject and get out of, i never had such a base. i never had a place i could call home that meant any more than a key to a house, apartment or hotel room. ... am i alien? alien from what exactly?

perhaps my home is my dream city, more real than my waking life precisely because it has no relation to waking life... panic is the sudden realization that everything around you is alive. how long does it take man to realize that he cannot want what he wants? you have to live in hell to see heaven. last night i encountered a dream cat with a very long neck and a body like a human fetus, gray and transluscent. i don't know what it needs or how to provide for it. another dream years ago of a human child with eyes on stalks. it is very small, but can walk and talk "don't you want me?" again, i don't know how to care for the child. but i am dedicated to protecting and nurturing him at any cost! it is the function of the guardian to protect hybrids and mutants in the vulnerable stage of infancy. well as, one judge said to the other, 'be just and if you can't be just be arbitrary.' regret cannot observe customary obscenities. for the last four years of her life, mother was in a nursing home called chateins in st. louis ... [s]ix months before she died i sent a mother's day card. there was a horrible, mushy poem in it. i remember feeling "vaguely guilty. i am trying like klee, to create something that will have a life of its own, that can put me in real danger, a danger which i willingly take on myself..

A functioning police state needs no police. anything that can be done chemically can be done by other means. happiness is a byproduct of function, purpose, and conflict; those who seek happiness for itself seek victory without war. be just and if you can't be just, be arbitrary. there are no innocent bystanders... what are they doing there in the first place? like all pure creatures, cats are practical. whether you like it or not, you are committed to the human endeavor. i cannot ally myself with such a purely negative goal as avoidance of suffering. suffering is a chance you take by the fact of being alive. how i hate those who are dedicated to producing conformity. and to start with it was like a novelty ventriloquist act. after a while, the ass started talking on its own. he would go in without anything prepared... and his ass would ad-lib and toss the gags back at him every time. but the asshole would eat its way through "because we don't need you and grow there. so, finally, his mouth sealed over... except for the eyes, you dig? of the brain behind the eyes. junk turns the user into a plant. plants do not feel pain since pain has no function in a stationary organism. junk is a pain killer. a plant has no libido in the human or animal sense. junk replaces the sex drive. seeding is the sex of the plant and the function of opium is to delay seeding. confusion hath fuck his masterpiece. you know, they ask me if i were on a desert island and i knew nobody would ever see what i wrote, would i go on writing. my answer is most emphatically yes. i would go on writing for company. because i'm creating an imaginary -- it's always imaginary -- world in which i would like to live. many doctors are drawn to this profession (psychology) because they have an innate deficiency of insight into the motives, feelings and thoughts of others, a deficiency they hope to remedy by ingesting masses of data. quien sabe? not me. the older i get the less i sabe, the less wisdom, maturity and caution i have. everything jack says is to be taken with considerable reserve. ever see a hot shot hit, kid? i saw the gimp catch one in philly. we rigged his room with a one-way whorehouse mirror and charged a sawski to watch it. he never got the needle out of his arm. they don't if the shot is right. that's the way they find them, dropper full of clotted blood hanging out of a blue arm. the look in his eyes when it hit --- kid, it was tasty. death needs time for what it kills to grow in. when you cut into the present, the future leaks out nobody's busting into your apartment at three in the morning, are they? well, then don't worry about what they're doing in south korea and places like that. it's like the standard of living. are you content to achieve your higher standard of living at the expense of people all over the world who've got a lower standard of living? most americans would say yes. now we ask the question, are you content to enjoy your political freedom at the expense of people who are less free? i think they would also say yes. here lies a stupid son of a bitch who tried to make death a company cop. control never be a means to any practical end. it can never be a means to anything but more control... like punk. a doctor is not criticized for describing the manifestations and symptoms of an illness, even though the symptoms may be disgusting. i feel that a writer has the right to the same freedom in fact, i think that the time has come for the line between literature and science, a purely arbitrary line, to be erased. moor did not have tuberculosis or kidney trouble or undulant fever.he was sick with the sickness of death.death was in every cell of his body. putting on a "b" production for a fruit..

The way to kill a man or a nation is to cut off his dreams, the way the whites are taking care of the indians: killing their dreams, their magic, their familiar spirits. hustlers of the world, there is one mark you cannot beat: the mark inside. silence is only frightening to people who are compulsively verbalizing. there is nothing more provocative than minding your own business. whether you like it or not, you are committed to the human endeavor. i cannot ally myself with such a purely negative goal as avoidance of suffering. suffering is a chance you take by the fact of being alive. day and night. the people in power will not disappear voluntarily, giving flowers to the cops just isn't going to work. this thinking is fostered by the establishment; they like nothing better than love and nonviolence. the only way i like to see cops given flowers is in a flower pot from a high window. precisely. arty type... no principles... for the last four years of her life, mother was in a nursing home called chateins in st. louis ... [s]ix months before she died i sent a mother's day card. there was a horrible, mushy poem in it. i remember feeling "vaguely guilty. moor did not have tuberculosis or kidney trouble or undulant fever.he was sick with the sickness of death.death was in every cell of his body..

Sometimes paranoia's just having all the facts. the first and most important thing an individual can do is to become an individual again, decontrol himself, train himself as to what is going on and win back as much independent ground for himself as possible the question is frequently asked: why does a man become a drug addict? the answer is that he usually does not intend to become an addict. you don't wake up one morning and decide to be a drug addict. it takes at least three months' shooting twice a day to get any habit at all. and you don't really know what junk sickness is until you have had several habits. it took me almost six months to get my first habit, and then the withdrawal symptoms were mild. i think it no exaggeration to say it takes about a year and several hundred injections to make an addict. the questions, of course, could be asked: why did you ever try narcotics? why did you continue using it long enough to become an addict? you become a narcotics addict because you do not have strong motivations in the other direction. junk wins by default. i tried it as a matter of curiosity. i drifted along taking shots when i could score. i ended up hooked. most addicts i have talked to report a similar experience. they did not start using drugs for any reason they can remember. they just drifted along until they got hooked. if you have never been addicted, you can have no clear idea what it means to need junk with the addict's special need. you don't decide to be an addict. one morning you wake up sick and you're an addict. (junky, prologue, p. xxxviii) the best way to keep something bad from happening is to see it ahead of time... and you can't see it if you refuse to face the possibility. nothing is true, everything is permitted. and to start with it was like a novelty ventriloquist act. after a while, the ass started talking on its own. he would go in without anything prepared... and his ass would ad-lib and toss the gags back at him every time. and it wanted to be kissed, day and night. you could hear him for blocks, the american uppermiddle-class citizen is a composite of negatives. he is largely delineated by what he is not. i know this one pusher walks around humming a tune and everybody he passes takes it up. he is so grey and spectral and anonymous they don't see him and think it is their own mind humming the tune. all over america, people were pulling credentials out of their pockets and sticking them under someone else's nose to prove they had been somewhere or done something. and i thought someday everyone in america will suddenly jump up and say, 'i don't take any shit!' and start pushing and cursing and clawing at the man next to him. he is a boy sleeping against the mosque wall, ejaculates wet dreaming into a thousand cunts pink and smooth as sea shells... many doctors are drawn to this profession (psychology) because they have an innate deficiency of insight into the motives, feelings and thoughts of others, a deficiency they hope to remedy by ingesting masses of data. now, killing a centipede makes me feel safer - like, one less. dreams less and less interesting. the only possible ethic is to do what one wants to do. the study of thinking machines teaches us more about the brain than we can learn by introspective methods. western man is externalizing himself in the form of gadgets. and there are my cats, engaged in a ritual that goes back thousands of years, tranquilly licking themselves after the meal. practical animals, they prefer to have others provide the food ... some of them do. there must have been a split between the cats who accepted domestication and those who did not..

There couldn't be a society of people who didn't dream. they'd be dead in two weeks. be just and if you can't be just, be arbitrary. in my writing i am acting as a map maker, an explorer of psychic areas, a cosmonaut of inner space, and i see no point in exploring areas that have already been thoroughly surveyed. the face of evil is always the face of total need. nothing exists until or unless it is observed. an artist is making something exist by observing it. and his hope for other people is that they will also make it exist by observing it. i call it 'creative observation.' creative viewing. man is an artifact designed for space travel. he is not designed to remain in his present biologic state any more than a tadpole is designed to remain a tadpole. it's the little touches that make a future solid enough to destroy. he thought this was cute at first shouting out it wanted equal rights. and it wanted to be kissed, same as any other mouth. day and night. he would tear it off his mouth that the asshole couldn't do was see. and infiltrated and atrophied. it was trapped inside the skull... because the eyes went out... as one judge said to another judge: be just. and if you can't be just, be arbitrary. for years i wondered why dreams are so often dull when related, and this morning i find the answer, which is very simple - like most answers, you have always known it: no context ... like a stuffed animal set on the floor of a bank. i know this one pusher walks around humming a tune and everybody he passes takes it up. he is so grey and spectral and anonymous they don't see him and think it is their own mind humming the tune. the 'other half' is the word. the 'other half' is an organism. word is an organism. the presence of the 'other half' is a separate organism attached to your nervous system on an air line of words can now be demonstrated experimentally. one of the most common 'hallucinations' of subject during sense withdrawal is the feeling of another body sprawled through the subject's body at an angle...yes quite an angle it is the 'other half' worked quite some years on a symbiotic basis. from symbiosis to parasitism is a short step. the word is now a virus. the flu virus may have once been a healthy lung cell. it is now a parasitic organism that invades and damages the central nervous system. modern man has lost the option of silence. try halting sub-vocal speech. try to achieve even ten seconds of inner silence. you will encounter a resisting organism that forces you to talk. that organism is the word. a phenomenon must be to some extent comprehensible to be perceived at all. (a boat in lake.) i was afraid it would turn over at high speed. nobody's busting into your apartment at three in the morning, are they? well, then don't worry about what they're doing in south korea and places like that. it's like the standard of living. are you content to achieve your higher standard of living at the expense of people all over the world who've got a lower standard of living? most americans would say yes. now we ask the question, are you content to enjoy your political freedom at the expense of people who are less free? i think they would also say yes. like pregnant women lose their teeth feeding the stranger, junkies lose their yellow fangs feeding the monkey. take a shot in front of d.l. probing for a vein in my dirty bare foot... junkies have no shame... they are impervious to the repugnance of others. it is doubtful if shame can exist in the absence of sexual libido... the junky's shame disappears with his nonsexual sociability which is also dependent on libido... a john is different from a sucker. when you're with a sucker you're on alert all the time. you give him nothing. a sucker is just to be taken but a john is different. you give him what he pays for. when you're with him you enjoy yourself and you want him to enjoy himself too. we're not fighting for a scrap of sharecropper immortality with the strings hanging off it like mafioso spaghetti. we want the whole tamale. the johnsons are taking over the western lands. we built it with our brains and our hands. we paid for it with our blood and our lives. it's ours and we're going to take it. and we are not applying in triplicate to the immortality control board. anybody gets in our way we will get our communal back against a rock or a tree and fight the way a raccoon will fight a fucking dog..
