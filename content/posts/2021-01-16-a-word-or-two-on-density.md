I am forever fascinated by GrowLA's [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/GrowLA). They are first-tier density cheerleaders, fervently committed to tearing down any and all Los Angeles and replacing it with vast swaths of multi-units. Here is their cover page:

__Advocacy_ group CA-YIMBY is funded by the Building Industry Association, Construction Trades Council, Regional Council of Carpenters, and the Plumbers & Pipefitters Union, God bless 'em_

Need I say, the _opposite_ of this graphic is the actual truth. According to studies by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, and all their various graphs involving demographic cross-tabulations of USFPP vs PPB (Unit Square Footage-Per-Person, Person-Per-Bedoom) and so forth, Americans in houses are "overhoused," meaning they have more elbow room, while Americans in denser areas and multiunits are "underhoused," i.e., suffering from overcrowding. This is true across all spectrums of race and ethnicity, income, metropolitan area, citizenship, etc. Don't know if the YIMBYs made an honest mistake here, or they're just lying liars who lie. I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, of course.

What sort of thing gets posted on GrowLA? This is typical:

_It's like looking down the Norden bombsight_

There's you answer, "get" the City of Los Angeles to "do this," what, through eminent domain? Tearing down single family homes is _always_ the answer. (We'll ignore the fact that 5,000+ units are already [under construction for UCLA right now](https://urbanize.city/la/post/progress-report-uclas-870m-student-housing-expansion).)

And what are we to replace Los Angeles' single-family-dwellings _with_? Micro-Units, of course!

_How can it be spread, John? Like any infectious disease, I suppose..._

When you read this article, you're supposed to feel warm and fuzzy because look! there's more units and they COST LESS! Win for millennials!

Of course, what they fail to explicate: When you spend that $2,305 for a one-bedroom you are getting on average 768 square feet. That is because average rent around there is $3/sf. _Ergo_, the 265 square foot apartment at MicroUnitz _should_ cost $795 a month. _Why_ then would you pay $1500, or $5.66 a square foot, for your tiny place, when $5.66/sf is the going rate in Beverly Hills? But think of the amenities! Like not...having...parking...or a closet.

But you're not supposed to ask these questions. You're supposed to just accept that we can add millions of new people to Los Angeles—it will all be ok because we can tear down the old neighborhoods, those homes and lawns and trees, and learn to live with _less_. (I wrote a little bit about glorified dorm life [in this post](https://www.riplosangeles.com/2019/10/13/so-ugly-too-ugly/).) It has been said that living with less is good for the environment, and far be it from me to argue with _that_. What it does to your soul be damned, of course. The individual (and certainly the soul) are outdated concepts, anyway.

The new way of living is certainly the pod. All hail [the pod](https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/05/success/podshare-co-living/index.html)! [Here is General Pod discussing life in the Pod](https://twitter.com/CNN/status/1146977277252648965). Moscow-born Elvina Beck, CEO of PodShare, formed PodShare "like the idea of the government giving you everything in a Communist state"...though you still have to pay $1200 for the privilege. Which I suppose is a step up from living in disused sewer pipes:

_I like the big glass wall that underscores "your basic human right to privacy is a lie"_

Los Angeles has been criticized as an exclusionary region for homebuyers, though at least homes kept selling, which prevented their demolition. As those monied, home-buying types [depart California](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/no-longer-a-boom-state-new-data-shows-residents-fleeing-california-in-near-record-numbers/ar-BB1bZ9xJ) [in general](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/like-california-residents-businesses-are-fleeing-the-golden-state) and [Los Angeles](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8631063/Hollywood-Apocalypse-rich-famous-fleeing-droves.html) in particular, the powers-that-be are only interested in filling the void with a vast sea of perpetual rent serfs who will never know antiquated concepts like "elbow room." I'm not sure how these PodPeople™ are going to pay the _rent_; Lord knows they won't be working for Disney or Universal or Warner Brothers (if any of us are left alive; at 59 people per acre, Los Angeles is considerably more dense than New York or Chicago \[47 and 41 people per acre, respectively\] and we are being absolutely hammered by the plague thanks to _that_). Maybe they can get a service industry jo—oh, damn. Wait I know, government can subsidize their rent, via the money-making Californians paying 62¢ out of every $1.00 they earn—oh that's right, those people [moved out of California](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2020/12/09/americas-three-richest-people-are-now-positioned-to-pay-zero-state-income-tax/?sh=68968ea37b63#:~:text=Bezos%20%28worth%20an%20estimated%20%24183.3%20billion%29%20and%20Gates,Nevada%2C%20New%20Hampshire%2C%20South%20Dakota%2C%20Tennessee%20and%20Wyoming.) because the government took 62¢ out of every dollar they earned.

Well then I guess I don't know _what_ will happen. People like me will keep complaining I suppose, but I am after all _the problem_, according to our pals at GrowLA:

_Yeahhh, my property taxes prop up your teacher's union, so you're welcome_

People will know about it! Me and that pesky politician who sides with the homeowner. (Because this blog exists to recount _all those times_ pesky politicians keep stepping in to save houses from becoming multiunit Jenga boxes.) But goddamn the homeowner! Who owns their home _at the expense of everybody else_! I can't wait till we do away with that pesky private property and fix _that_!

Whither Los Angeles? Will we end up living as atomized ants in a great isolating colony? These kooky kids of to-day love them some globalism, and the Great Reset promulgated by their kreepy king Klaus Schwab, who is working for the abolition of private property (of _your_ private property, that is; elites [buy up everything](https://www.forbes.com/sites/arielshapiro/2021/01/14/americas-biggest-owner-of-farmland-is-now-bill-gates-bezos-turner/?sh=7cda1ca66096) with the money you gave them). [So when Los Angeles becomes this](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/how-life-could-change-2030/), and I hear you say "once in awhile I get annoyed about the fact that I have no real privacy. No where I can go and not be registered. I know that, somewhere, everything I do, think and dream of is recorded." but at least it's "much better than the path we were on!" I will punch you in the...no, I'm sure I will say _Hail General Pod_.
