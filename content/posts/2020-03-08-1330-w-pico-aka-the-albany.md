Architectural historian Nathan Marsak loves Los Angeles, and hates to see important buildings neglected and abused, whether by slumlord owners or the savage public. Follow him on his urban adventures as he sees something that looks like crap, opens his yap and spontaneously lets you know exactly why this place matters.

Episode 24 finds Nathan on the eastern edge of the Pico-Union Historic Preservation Overlay Zone (HPOZ), a charming, low-slung early 20th century neighborhood of craftsman bungalows, apartment houses, churches and mortuaries that feels a world away from the Convention Center on the other side of the 110 Freeway.

But there’s big trouble brewing on this little block, all wrapped up in a land use mystery that’s had L.A.‘s preservation community scratching its collective head.

HPOZs are supposed to be protected, with historic buildings preserved and the rare new construction respecting what’s already there. So why did Gil Cedillo, the councilman who represents this impoverished district, file a motion carving a warehouse out of the HPOZ, upzoning it for high-rise hotel use? And how did zillionaire developer Eri Kroh of Sandstone Properties anticipate that the zoning would change when he spent $42 Million to aquire the property?

It just didn’t make sense.

But that was before public records activist Adrian Riskin of the [Michael Kohlhaas blog](https://michaelkohlhaas.org)“ got interested. He recently obtained emails from Gil Cedillo’s office that reveal exactly how Sandstone hit the real estate jackpot.

The infuriating answer is that Gil Cedillo’s staff worked overtime to look after the developer, even when it meant telling the Mayor’s office to back off on discussions about turning the warehouse into much-needed homeless housing. The talking points that planning director Gerald Gubatan used when encouraging “the zealot” Ken Bernstein at City Planning to break up the HPOZ were written by Sandstone’s lobbyists. So were the City Council motions submitted by Gil Cedillo. All Cedillo had to do was whip out a pen and sign his name, and a neighborhood’s doom was sealed.

Anyone who cares about the wretched state of our beloved Los Angeles, the demolitions and tent encampments, the illegal Airbnb listings and unaffordable rents, the squandered Measure HHH housing funds, the filth and the cruelty, should read the blog post describing these emails, and possibly the emails as well.

To get a taste of how special this block is, and why it’s entirely unsuitable for the enormous tower and sign district requested by Sandstone’s lobbyists and provided by their friendly councilman, let the Cranky Preservationist take you on a tour. You’ll see beauty, surprises, sorrow and a very special slice of sidewalk along the way.

Open your eyes, friends! Terrible people are bleeding Los Angeles dry with their Sacramento-style policy savvy and lack of compassion, and some of them will retire with government pensions. They’re destroying our neighborhoods and shortening our neighbors’ lives.

But we don’t have to settle for this twisted lack of representation. The only question is how much longer will YOU stand for it?
